# 1. Application Security Verification Standard
During this course, we have covered some very important topics about web application security. However, you have to keep in mind that this course is by no means an exhaustive summary of all possible attacks. Therefore, if you ever release a real-life application, you should first validate it using the Application Security Verification standard. This standard provides a basis for designing, building, and testing technical application security controls, including architectural concerns, secure development lifecycle, threat modelling, agile security including continuous integration / deployment, serverless, and configuration concerns.

Certain parts of this standard are part of the required study material (see Digitap for an overview of these parts). In any case, read through the whole standard to **get a comprehensive overview** of all the controls that you should include in your web application. Go to [https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS#latest-released-version](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS#latest-released-version)  to download the latest version of the standard.
